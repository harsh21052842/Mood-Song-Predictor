# Mood-Based Song Recommendation System ðŸŽ¶

This project leverages **Mediapipe**, **OpenCV (cv2)**, and **Neural Networks** to create an intelligent mood prediction and song recommendation system. By analyzing facial expressions, it predicts the userâ€™s mood and suggests songs from YouTube that match the detected emotion.
